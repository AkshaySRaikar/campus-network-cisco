# Campus Network Design (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This repository contains a Cisco Packet Tracer project simulating a 
campus network topology with approximately 50 nodes. The design 
represents a structured, layered campus layout with different 
departments, routers, switches, and end-user devices.

---

## 📁 Project File

- "campus_network_topology.pkt": The main Cisco Packet Tracer file for the network.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- Multi-layered topology (Core, Distribution, Access)
- VLAN implementation 
- IP addressing scheme (DHCP)
- Inter-VLAN routing
- Separate networks for departments
- Realistic device configuration (Routers, Switches, PCs)
